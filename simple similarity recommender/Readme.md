
Recommender System Collection
Overview
This repository contains a collection of recommender system implementations based on different similarity and distance metrics. Each subfolder focuses on a specific algorithm used to calculate similarity between items or users and build recommendation models.

Included Recommenders
Cosine Movie Recommender
Implements item similarity and recommendations based on the Cosine Similarity metric, commonly used in collaborative filtering and text analysis.

Dice Coefficient Recommender
Calculates similarity between binary feature vectors using the Dice Coefficient, ideal for cases with binary attributes.

Euclidean Distance Recommender
Uses Euclidean Distance as a measure of dissimilarity between items and recommends based on closest distances.

Jaccard Similarity Recommender
Computes similarity between sets using the Jaccard Index, especially effective for binary or set-based features.
