Jaccard Similarity Recommender
This project contains a simple implementation of a Jaccard similarity-based recommender system. It calculates the similarity between items represented by binary attributes using the Jaccard coefficient.

Description
The Jaccard similarity measures the similarity between two sets by dividing the size of their intersection by the size of their union. It is particularly useful for comparing binary or categorical data.

This implementation takes binary feature vectors for items and computes pairwise similarity scores.

Features
Calculate Jaccard similarity between items with binary attributes

Simple and clear Python implementation using NumPy

Suitable for recommender systems and similarity analysis on binary data

Usage
Define your items with binary feature vectors in the items dictionary.

Use the jaccard_similarity function to calculate the similarity between two items.

Run the script to see similarity scores between all pairs of items.
