Project Overview
This project implements a simple recommender system that calculates similarity between items based on their binary attributes using the Dice Coefficient. The main goal is to measure the similarity between items and support building similarity-based recommendation models.

Features
Calculates the Dice coefficient between two binary feature arrays

Displays similarity scores between different items

Simple and extensible implementation using numpy

Suitable for learning and understanding binary similarity measures

The coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect similarity.

Usage
Define the binary features of your items in the items dictionary. When you run the code, it will print the Dice similarity between each pair of items.
